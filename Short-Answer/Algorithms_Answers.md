Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

a) O(n^3 / n^2) ==> O(n)
Covering n^3 at a rate of n^2 will leave O(n)

b) O(n/2 _ n/2 _ n/2 + 9) ==> O((n/2)^3 + 9) ==> O(n)^3
After ignoring the constants, the function should have the shape of O(n)^3

c) O(n)
For each function call, the is one recursive function call until the base case.
Meaning the function will be called n times
